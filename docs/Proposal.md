## Proposal

The focus of the project is to look at what if any the quality of the nursing homes in an area have on the prevelence of HIV infection in the same area. The hypothesis being the areas with better nursing homes will have lower levels of HIV infection. This would then validate spending on raising the quality of nursing home care as a viable method of combating the spread of HIV which is the end goal.

This will be built off of the work done by Groups 1 & 2.

Using a revised data pipeline implemented by the previous two groups we will be doing predictive modeling using nursing home score among our features. If the hypothesis holds true we should see an inverese relationship between nursing home score and HIV prevalence.
