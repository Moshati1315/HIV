## Story

Hundreds of millions of federal dollars have been allocated for treatment and eradication HIV. The goal of this study is to look for socioeconomic factors that could give rise to more equitable allocation of funds. The results could have implications for policy makers and government agencies administering those funds. This project builds from previous work accomplished in DS5110 students. Dr. Olivieri-Mui is very interested in seeing this work continue and ready to engage as needed!

## Data

Socieeconomic data at Census.gov added as a new data source to build on work done by DS 5110 students.
