Dataset Variables

The downloadable datasets may have suppressed/missing values for several reasons. Suppressed and/or missing data are represented as -1, -2, -4, or -9 in the dataset and indicate the following:

-1: Data are not shown to protect privacy because a small number of cases and/or a small population size for reasons listed in the Data Suppression and Rate Stability section.
-2: Data were not released to AIDSVu because the state health department, per its HIV data re-release agreement with CDC, requested not to release data to AIDSVu below a certain population threshold. The data re-release agreement was updated last year, which is why the data for this year may look different than last year.
-4: Data are not available at county-level for these counties as this time.

-9: Data are missing.

The downloadable datasets include a rate stability variable for each indicator. As is standard in the display of health statistics, rates generated from a numerator less than 12 are considered unreliable and should be interpreted with caution.

Y: Reliable rates (i.e. those generated with a numerator of 12 or greater)

N: Unreliable rates (i.e. those generated with a numerator less than 12)

Rate stability for suppressed rates is listed as -9 for HIV data and -1 for PrEP data.

Please see the “Data Suppression and Rate Stability” section of the Data Methods above for specific information regarding the suppression rules and rate stability criteria.
