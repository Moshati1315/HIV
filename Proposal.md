## Story

The focus of the project is to look at what if any the quality of the nursing homes in an area have on the prevelence of HIV infection in the same area. The hypothesis being the areas with better nursing homes will have lower levels of HIV infection. This would then validate spending on raising the quality of nursing home care as a viable method of combating the spread of HIV which is the end goal.

Building off the work done by students of DS5110 previously we will be building a model to see if the data supports this hypothesis. We will also be improving the accessibility of the interactive graphs and images created previously in the repo listed below.
